# About

Perhaps it's possible to create a pro-social pledge that appeals to a broad range of entrepreneurs. You'll often hear from technology entrepreneurs that their work generates immense returns to scale, yet it's not always obvious to them that those returns should be solely claimed by the ones who harness that force.

Maybe there's another equilibrium that satisfies the entrepreneur, their supporters and peers, and the broader society. Such a pledge should allow the builder to be productive, bring peace of mind, and create space for others to benefit from the returns.

It should be obvious and easy for most entrepreneurs to take the pledge early in their journey; a one-size-fits-all. The price should be enough to satisfy every argument about needs and wants: family security plus every category of adventure in wealth. The reward is the opening of paths — more supporters, and more freedom of movement within a community of people you want to belong with.

## Pricing

### Why do you even need a priced cap?

At a more abstract level, economies function better with clear prices. The infinite rewards from returns to scale are a kind of expectation in market economies.

For a number of reasons, a cap benefits the entrepreneurial community. It allows exceptional leaders to design games that recruit other talented entrepreneurs. More importantly, there is an untapped reserve of doers in the world who won’t conform to the winner-takes-all culture.

An early commitment also benefits the entrepreneur. After a point, more money brings more problems. Your standards will shift as you become more successful, and you can lose clarity. With a number written in stone, you’ll know when you’ve made it.

### How do you arrive at this price?

We aim to use the price of producing the marginal entrepreneur.

The goal is to cross the threshold of what it takes for someone to make a lifelong leap into entrepreneurship, but no more. The price holds informational value for the entrepreneur: perhaps it buys peace of mind, or satisfies curiosity about the various adventures in wealth.

To most of the public, it will seem like a fantastical sum. The number comes from a thought experiment — a Fermi Estimation — where any figure in the range qualifies someone for a lifetime of luxury.

Should it be $30M? That seems sufficiently luxurious. At the upper end, $60M can buy you ten properties in desirable cities. Enough for you, your ex-wife, and your children across multiple marriages. Enough for dynastic wealth, for those curious about that. On the lower end, $15M is still enough for all types of amusement. You won’t be buying a $30M penthouse in Manhattan, but you could certainly rent one and see if it changes how you feel.

Could the number be $10M? It may seem implausible to the general public, but you’ll hear people argue that $5M isn’t enough to retire in many desirable locations. It might barely cover the cost of owning and maintaining a comfortable primary residence. It’s excellent money, but maybe not high enough to produce the marginal entrepreneur. You might prefer a steady executive job, with good work-life balance and wise retirement accounts.

$20M is in the middle. Still, $10M — though fabulous — might not be enough for an entrepreneur to retire at 25. Nor is it dramatically more than what a high-performing executive could earn after a career in Silicon Valley with thoughtful financial planning. Close, but it may not move the marginal entrepreneur.

So the range seems to be between $20M and $30M. Let’s use $25M, since it rhymes with the year 2025.

## Alternatives

There are alternatives like the Giving Pledge or Effective Altruism, where you revisit decisions about wealth as frequently as you like. This is exhausting to do well, and often done with dubious intent. The goal here is to create a commitment many entrepreneurs could sign up for without overthinking it, and one that actually makes their lives better.

### Effective Altruism

It’s great if you can do it. The issue is that Effective Altruists often feel like they’re failing. The implied vow of poverty sets an unreasonable expectation that leaves you feeling like you’re always falling short. Better to set a threshold on extreme luxury and allow yourself to feel comfortably under the limit. Also, Effective Altruism is hard to reason about. It feels like an intellectual exercise. Good mechanisms should have incentives that are obvious and easy to understand. Lastly, as of 2025, the brand is diluted, if not discredited.

### The Giving Pledge

Essentially, it has no real commitments or responsibilities. It’s also not a wealth cap. It allows for unlimited wealth accumulation during your lifetime and only limits inheritance. This seems like a whitewashing of extreme avarice. Entrepreneurs need to make a commitment to other doers and makers in society, and lower the bar on status signaling, which is a distraction.
